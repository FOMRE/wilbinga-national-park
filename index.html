<h2>A Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity</h2>
<p>
Wilbinga National Park represents a rare opportunity to permanently protect coastal bushland at Perth’s northern boundary between Two Rocks and the Moore River Estuary.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
80% of the proposed area is already zoned Conservation or Recreation.
</div>

<p>
Establishing Wilbinga as a National Park would safeguard biodiversity, groundwater systems, Indigenous heritage and provide sustainable tourism and recreation opportunities.
